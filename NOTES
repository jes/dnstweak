Does resolv.conf allow explicit port numbers? If so, how?
    No.

What is the best way to run a DNS server in Go?
    https://github.com/miekg/dns ?

Can I work out what PID a request comes from, for logging purposes?

Requirements for MVP:
 - intercept A lookups
 - pass-through non-A lookups
 - support multiple IP addresses and return them in a random order

Nice-to-have:
 - automatically insert into resolv.conf
 - listen on ipv6 as well as ipv4

Future:
 - maybe intercept CNAME, AAAA, etc.
 - support the zonefile idea

Todo:
 - parse existing resolv.conf
 - listen on port 53 (what if there is already a local resolver?)
 - write new resolv.conf
 - forward requests to the previous resolver
 - put resolv.conf back on exit
 - work out the originating PID of each request
